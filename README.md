# Regression with FFNN
An interactive visualisation of regression learning with feed-forward neural network (FFNN) model using the [Tensorflow.js](https://www.tensorflow.org/js/) framework

## How to use
- Go to [Regression with FFNN](https://vquynh.github.io/ffnn-regression/)
- **To test or train a pre-trained model further**:
  - Select a model from the model list: "Under Fitting", "Best Fitting", "Over Fitting"
  - Change the parameters for data setting as desired:
    - `Samples`: number of [x,y] value pairs
    - `Noise variance`: the amplitude of the noise added to the y value, the higher the value the less uniform the data graph will look compared to the actual graph of the function 
  - Click on `Test model` to see model's predictions compared to original data.
